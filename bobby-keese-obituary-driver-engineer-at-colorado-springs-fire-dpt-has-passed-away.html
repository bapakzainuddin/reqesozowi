The circumstances surrounding his untimely passing remain unclear, leaving the department and the community in shock. Bobby Keese, a dedicated and exemplary member of the Colorado Springs Fire Department, had a career that spanned over three decades. He assumed the role of Driver/Engineer in February 1999,.</p><p>His journey in the department began on May 17th, 1993. At the time of his passing, Bobby was stationed at Station 22, proudly serving on the B-shift. Bobby’s commitment to the fire service was not just a job; it was a calling passed down through generations. His father, also a Driver/Engineer, had joined the department in 1969, and Bobby continued the family legacy with pride and dedication. Fire Chief Randy Royal, reflecting on Bobby’s service and character, spoke of him with the highest regard: “I worked with Bobby over the years, and for those that did not know him.</p><p>I can say he would rate in the ‘one of the nicest guy’ categories. He was always willing to help others and served our citizens with excellence. He was an excellent driver, who poured his knowledge and experience into others while he enthusiastically coached and mentored them. I would say almost every driver on the job has either directly or indirectly been impacted by his passion for the fire apparatus driving profession, and his input into our apparatus design and apparatus operations.”</p><p>In this difficult time, we ask the community to join us in keeping Bobby’s wife, children, and family members in your thoughts and prayers. Their loss is immeasurable, and our hearts go out to them as they navigate through this painful journey of grief. Bobby Keese’s legacy will forever burn bright in the Colorado Springs Fire Department. He leaves behind a void that can never be filled, but his memory will serve as a reminder of the unwavering dedication and selflessness that defines the men and women who stand ready to protect and serve our community. As the department and community mourn the loss of one of their own, they are reminded of the profound impact one individual can have when they dedicate their life to a noble cause. Bobby Keese, you will be dearly missed, but your spirit and legacy will continue to guide and inspire us all.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwrs6bmbJlm5qytLGMqJmirKWWv7p5w6ugr52iYrKvs8innJ6qXZbBbq%2FOpaarmZSkerS80aKloKtdm7azsYydp61lmJbAbrzArKqenF2WxKLFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./antonia-gentry-parents-the-story-of-the-ginny-georgia-stars-biracial-family.html><span>←</span><span>Antonia Gentry Parents: The Story of the Ginny &amp;amp; Georgia Stars Biracial Family</span></a>
