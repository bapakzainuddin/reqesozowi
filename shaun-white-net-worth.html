White spent his early years in his homeland, and his career as a snowboarder started here too. His first serious success was with skateboarding: he is known to be a close friend of <a href=#>Tony Hawk</a> – a legend in the world of skateboarding because of his great abilities, and also thanks to <a href=#>Tony Hawk</a>‘s Pro Skater game series.</p><p>In his teenage years White was seriously involved in skateboarding, but Shaun’s net worth was actually increased mostly thanks to his talent as a snowboarder. After many attempts White received his first Gold Medal at the Winter X Games in 2002. But this medal was not the only one – uo until the last Games in 2012 he ha won 12 more Gold Medals, as well as three Silvers and two Bronzes. But the rest of the world know the Future Boy also because of his amazing win in 2006’s Olympic games in Turin, where he received a Gold Medal – this was one of the greatest highlights in Shaun’s career, which helped him to build up net worth and continue working on his successful future.</p><p>Of course, almost all net worth accumulated by Shaun White has been earned because of his career as a snowboareder, but for the people interested in the other directions of entertainment White’s name is recognizable also because of his appearance in “Friends with Benefits” – the movie released in 2011, where Shaun’s net worth was increased thanks to his ability to act together with such famous actors as Patricia Clarkson, Nolan Gould, Mila Kunis and <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a>.</p><p>Later he also appeared in one of the episodes of the “American Dad!” TV series.
