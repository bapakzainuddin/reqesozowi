They separated two years later when Johnson filed for divorce because of her inability to keep up with Wayne's lifestyle and his affair with singer Nivea Hamilton.</p><p class=dh>Like her father, Reginae is into entertainment. At 21, she has already been featured in several reality shows, including "My Super Sweet 16," "Growing Up Hip Hop: Atlanta," and "T.I. & Tiny: Friends & Family Hustle."</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>What drew fans was the uncanny resemblance he shares with Wayne.</strong></h3><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/lil-wayne-kids>Reginae got more popular</a> during the quarantine when she used social media as an outlet for her creativity.

Kameron made headlines once more when a video of him jamming to Lil Baby and 42 Dugg's surfaced on Triller.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>NEAL CARTER</strong></p><p class=dh>Neal was born on November 30, 2009. <a class="me a" href=#>Wayne</a> shares him with R&B crooner Nivea Hamilton.
