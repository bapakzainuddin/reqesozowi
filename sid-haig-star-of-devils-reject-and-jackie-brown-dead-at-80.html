Sid Haig, best known for playing Captain Spaulding in horror films by Rob Zombie — including “House of 1,000 Corpses” and its sequel “The Devil’s Rejects” — died Saturday. The actor was 80.
“He has returned to the Universe, a shining star in her heavens,” his wife Susan L. Oberg wrote in a post on his Instagram. In a since-deleted comment posted Sept. 13, Oberg wrote that Haig — whose given name was Sidney Eddie Mosesian — had taken a “nasty spill” but was “winning the fight,” Entertainment Weekly reported."><meta name=author content="Patria Henriques"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
