You can get a membership to regularly charter private jets at reduced rates."</p><p>"No Brett clearly said he helped book and provide the jet," another person added.</p><p>Another social media user chimed in, "It’s not her own private jet, she charters them through a fairly reasonably priced company called 'Wheels Up.'

We’re in the ‘Shark Tank’ era where a lot of people want to play with other people’s money because it’s a lot easier. I’ve put my entire savings and everything into my company.
