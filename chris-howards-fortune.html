Howard, born on the 5th of May, 1975, is a former American football player in the National Football League. He rose to fame during his tenure with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Denver Broncos.</p><p>So, what is Howard’s net worth? According to reliable sources, his net worth is estimated to be $6 million, as of early 2017, which he accumulated during his career as a professional football player.</p><h3>Chris Howard Net Worth $6 million</h3><p>Howard, hailing from Kenner, Louisiana, began playing football during high school. He was a prominent member of the Louisiana High School football team at John Curtis Christian High School. His exceptional skills led him to the University of Michigan.</p><p>During his time at Michigan, Howard played for the college’s football team, the Michigan Wolverines, as a running back. A defining moment in his college career was winning the 1997 National Championship and the 1997 NCAA Division I-A football in his final year.</p><p>In 1998, he was honored with the Hula Bowl MVP award. Upon his college graduation, he secured 1,876 yards rushing on 418 carries and 429 receiving yards on 60 receptions.</p><p>Following his impressive college performance, Howard swiftly entered the National Football League. In 1998, he was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the fifth round. His contract with the Broncos marked the beginning of his professional career and financial success.</p><p>Despite his consistent college performance, Howard faced challenges establishing himself in the professional league. He grappled with fumbling issues during pre-season practice with the Broncos, raising concerns among the team’s leadership. Consequently, the Broncos released him without him playing an official game.</p><p>Subsequently, Howard found a new opportunity with the Jacksonville Jaguars following his release from the Broncos. Although he encountered similar fumbling issues, the team persisted with him, nurturing his skills from the ground up. Through dedicated training, he showed improvement and eventually played for the team during the season.</p><p>Howard ultimately played with the Jaguars for three seasons before retiring from his professional football career in 2000.
