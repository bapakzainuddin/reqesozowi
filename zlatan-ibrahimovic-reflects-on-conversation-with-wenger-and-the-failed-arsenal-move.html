Last week, I was playing PlayStation with these guys. I spoke with Wenger, and he surprised me because he was taller than I expected.”</p><p>Recalling the meeting, Ibrahimovic said, “I entered his office, and we spoke. He wanted to know me, to understand me. I think he’s the type of person who doesn’t just buy a player; he wants to know what he’s getting. In the end, he had an Arsenal shirt with Number 9 and said, ‘We want you to come and do a trial for two weeks.’</p><p>“Everything seemed good until he mentioned the trial. I looked at him. Obviously, he was Wenger, and I was nobody at that moment. I said, ‘I don’t do trials.’ He asked, ‘What do you mean?’</p><p>“I replied, ‘I don’t do trials. Either you want me or you don’t. Otherwise, why am I here?'” Ibrahimovic explained. “That was my stance. It wasn’t about playing a game; it was about me. ‘No, but you have to come and do a trial.’ And I said, ‘No, no, you don’t understand, I don’t do trials.’ And that was it. I never went to Arsenal.”</p><p><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmixpZmklrtutcGrmKGhnaTDqq%2BMq5yfpJWYwbR5zqdknKeeq7Kzv8CtoKimXay2tbSMsJynn5WneqK6w2aroZ1dm66quMSdZJqqo5q7oriMpqavnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-monastero-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Tragic Loss!
