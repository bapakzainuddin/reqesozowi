The funeral service will commence promptly at 10:30 AM.</p><p>The May family extends an invitation to everyone who wishes to join in remembering and celebrating Daniel’s life during this time. In honor of Daniel, there will not be a choir for this particular service, allowing for a more intimate reflection on the memories and the impact he had on those around him. Following the funeral service, a light lunch will be served, providing an opportunity for friends and family to gather, share stories, and offer comfort to one another.</p><p>Contributions of desserts for the lunch are warmly appreciated and can be coordinated through the designated contacts. As we mourn the loss of Daniel May, we ask that you keep his family in your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. Your support and presence are invaluable as they navigate through the grief of losing a beloved member of their family.</p><p>In lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests that donations be made in Daniel’s memory. This gesture will help honor his legacy by supporting a cause that was close to his heart. Daniel May’s life was a testament to love, kindness, and unwavering faith. May he rest in eternal peace, and may his memory continue to inspire and bring solace to those who knew and loved him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmanBrbHHqKysnV6asbZ61admnZmenrKtecyasGankp7Btq3RsmSdnZGptW7CyKygrZmknryvecWupZ6qkaF6tLHRr6CcnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brooke-langton-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Brooke Langton Net Worth</span></a>
