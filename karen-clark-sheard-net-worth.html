She is also the mother of contemporary gospel singer and actress <a href=#>Kierra Sheard</a>. Karen Clark has been active in the entertainment industry since 1970.</p><p>How rich is the singer? It has been calculated by authoritative sources that the total size of Karen Clark Sheard’s net worth is equal to $10 million, as of the data given in the middle of 2016. Singing is the main source of Sheard’s wealth.</p><h3>Karen Clark Sheard Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>To begin with, Karen Clark Sheard grew up the youngest of six siblings in a family based in Detroit. Her parents are the pastor Elbert Clark and a gospel director of choirs in Detroit, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.</p><p>Concerning her professional career, Karen Clark Sheard is best known as a member of the gospel group The Clark Sisters, comprising Elbernita Clark, Jacky Clark Chisholm, <a href=#>Dorinda Clark Cole</a> and herself; she is the soprano of the group and is known for her high vocal skills. Singers including <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a>, <a href=#>Faith Evans</a>, Coko of SWV, Jovan Lacroix, <a href=#>Blu Cantrell</a>, <a href=#>Lil’ Mo</a>, <a href=#>Missy Elliott</a> and Fantasy were Sheard’s vocal influences. The Clark Sisters are considered as one of the pioneers of contemporary gospel. In 1973, they recorded their first album “Jesus Has A Lot to Give” for Billmo Records, owned by their uncle. A year later they released “Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents The Clark Sisters” and the group began to gain popularity in Michigan. In 1974, they had already signed with Sound of Gospel Records, which released “Unworthy” (1976), “Count It All Joy” (1978) and “He Gave Me Nothing to Lose” (1979). Real success came in 1980 with “Is My Living In Vain”, a live album that occupied the gospel charts for more than a year. In 1981, a big hit “You Brought the Sunshine” was released, and a year later “Sincerely” and singles “Name It And Claim It” and “World”. Karen’s net worth was rising steadily.</p><p>After that Denise left the group, and four years later they released the album “Heart & Soul”, a Grammy nomination. Karen released her solo album in 1997 entitled “Finally Karen”, which became one of the most successful gospel albums in 1998 and won a nomination for a Grammy, plus earning her a Soul Train Lady of Soul Award in the category of the Best Female Vocalist. Her second studio album “2nd Chance” (2002) reached 2nd place on the Billboard Gospel Albums, but her third studio album “The Heavens Are Telling” (2003) failed to succeed. However, another critical success even though it charted only modestly was the next album, “It’s Not Over” (2005).</p><p>In 2010, Karen Clark released “All in One”, and the same year she won a Grammy Award for the Best Gospel Performance. In 2011, the album “The Ultimate Collection” was released. Recently, the live album “Destined to Win” peaked in 2nd position on the Billboard Top Gospel Albums and 4th on Independent Albums charts. Overall, all the above mentioned albums have increased the outright size of Karen Clark Sheard.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the singer, she is married to a pastor, John Drew Sheard, and they have two children.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=36.690026954178><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Karen Clark Sheard</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 15, 1960</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Detroit, Michigan, United States</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>American gospel singer, musician, songwriter, actress</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>John Drew Sheard</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Kierra Kiki Sheard, John Drew Sheard II</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Elbert Clark</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Dorinda Clark Cole, Twinkie Clark, Jacqueline Cullum</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nicknames</td><td>Karen Clark-Sheard , Karen Valencia Clark , Sheard, Karen Clark , KCS</td></tr><tr readability=0.37209302325581><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/officialkcs</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34146341463415><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/officialkcs</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.32142857142857><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/officialkarewrecords/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/officiallykarenclarksheard</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm2012591</a></td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Awards</td><td>Grammy Award for Best Gospel Performance (2010), Grammy Award for Best Gospel Song (2008), Soul Train Lady of Soul Award for Best Gospel Album, 1998;
