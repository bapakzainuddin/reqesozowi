He has been a resident in Orland Park for a very long time. He has been the devoted husband of Dolores “Dee” Nee Mohr for the past 64 years. Even though we understand that death is an inevitable part of life, we are never prepared to part ways with a loved one for good.</p><p>No one ever wants to experience the pain of losing a loved one since the resulting feeling has the potential to pull people apart and is challenging for everyone. When one offers condolences or sympathy, the intention is to convey as much compassion, concern, and connection as possible to the person who has recently lost a loved one. In circumstances that are so fraught with sensation, it might be challenging to articulate how you are truly feeling.</p><p>Beloved father of The Late David Mathias (Tracy), Fred Mathias, Tom Mathias, Robert Mathias (Lisa née Webber), and Lori Mathias (Glenn). Grandfather of David, Michael, Frederic, Erin (Bryan) Nemeth, Colin, Kelsey (Chuck) Passi, Brian, Madison, Caylee, Claire, Samantha, Haylie, and Lucas, Jessica, and Marcus Mathias. Also great-grandfather of Madison, Caylee, Claire, Samantha, and Haylie.</p><p>Great-great-grandfather of Rylee Mulhausen, as well as Jack and Emma Nemeth Willenman, brother of the late Jane, who passed away. From 1949 to 1952, Fred was a member of the Navy’s “Fighting Seabees” and served our country. Served on the school board for District 230 for more than ten years. Proud to be a member of both the VFW and the American Legion. The only thing other than baseball that he loved more than that was his family. “Over and out….good buddy!”</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwstGiq7Nlnaq5qa3UrJynZZ%2BXtrXBwKuwZqWfoLKvrYyio6WhnqS2tHnFq6Ctsl2iwq20wK6qnqZdna60ecOinJ1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dylan-lyons-identified-as-journalist-killed-in-shooting.html><span>←</span><span>Florida Spectrum 13 reporter Dylan Lyons killed in shooting</span></a>
