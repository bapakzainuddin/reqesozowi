Their presence and efforts have had a major impact on the area, shaping its overall character. For three decades, Tim Derbyshire was not simply the owner of a record store; he was also well-known for being the guardian of On The Beat records.</p><p>His love of music was infectious, and his shop became into a haven for people looking for unusual finds and inspirational music. When he made the historic decision to sell his store on eBay in 2013, many of the customers who had frequented it over the years felt bereaved. Gregorio was a fixture on Hanway Street for many years, more than just a resident.</p><p>Many passersby were won over by his warm hospitality and endearing demeanor, and they probably struck up a discussion or enjoyed a drink with him. He had a unique charisma that made everyone who came into contact with him feel welcome on this street. Hanway Street is not the same when they leave. We celebrate the lives they led and the impact they left behind in this town, even as we sorrow their departure.</p><p>Though they are no longer with us, it is consoling to think of them at a place where music is constantly playing a fitting tribute to Tim’s energy and Gregorio’s kind disposition. The people who had the good fortune to know them will always remember their legacies. As we bid these dear ones farewell, let us carry on the legacy of love and friendship they established so that their influence will live on forever on Hanway Street.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmanBrbHHqKysnV6asbZ61admraGdYrGmvsGyqqGhopp6sK7Irayaqqlir7Otw6WcsqtdqL2iusisn2aakad6rrvUq6VmmV2htqexy6iloGWdmrqjsdFmm56ZpJ18</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./256207-tichina-arnold-celebrates-daughter-alija-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tichina Arnold Celebrates Daughter Alijah's 17th Birthday with a Sweet Video of Her Childhood</span></a>
