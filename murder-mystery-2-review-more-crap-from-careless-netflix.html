In the first film, the Spitzes (who, in an early indicator of James Vanderbilt’s script’s level of humor, a pilot calls the Sh-tzes) stumbled into amateur sleuthing like Miss Marple."><meta name=author content="Billy Koelling"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Rated PG-13 (violence, bloody images, strong language, suggestive material and smoking). On Netflix.</p><p>In the first film, the Spitzes (who, in an early indicator of James Vanderbilt’s script’s level of humor, a pilot calls the Sh-tzes) stumbled into amateur sleuthing like Miss Marple. Nick (Sandler) was an NYPD officer and Audrey (Aniston) was a hairdresser.</p><p>This time they’re pros like Hercule Poirot.&nbsp;</p><p>They’re summoned to the luxurious private island of their uber-rich friend from the last movie, the Maharaja (Adeel Akhtar), to attend his wedding to girlfriend Claudette (Mélanie Laurent).</p><p>Set at a stunning resort, the start of the movie is “The Slight Lotus.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Colonel Miller (Mark Strong, center) is one of an ensemble of not-eccentric-enough characters in “Murder Mystery 2.” <span class=credit>©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>At the ritzy ceremony, complete with fleeting choreographed dancing and an elephant, the Maharajah’s bodyguard is murdered and the Maharaja is kidnapped.&nbsp;</p><p>The Spitzes start clumsily questioning the suspects, each one more boring than the last.</p><p>There’s Francisco (Enrique Arce), a former soccer player and lothario who announces, “I have made love to 10,000 women”; the bride Claudette, who was forced to sign a suffocating prenup; his sister Saira (Kuhoo Verma), who loves attention; Countess Sekou (Jodie Turner-Smith, so much better than this) and the colonel (John Kani), who the Maharaja denied a promotion.</p><p>When Colonel Miller (Mark Strong) from MI6 shows up to take over the case, the anonymous kidnapper calls and demands $60 million delivered to the very unassuming Arc de Triomphe in Paris in exchange for their captive. Sandler jokingly, unbearably calls it “the Arc de Tree Hump?”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">At the Maharaja’s island wedding, the Spitzes are thrust into another silly murder case. <span class=credit>Scott Yamano/Netflix © 2023</span></figure><p>“I don’t want these buffoons involved anymore!,” announces Claudette.&nbsp;</p><p>As Aniston and Sandler are so uncharacteristically charmless and unfunny here while they scream and flail around Paris, we can’t help but agree with her.</p><p>In the City of Lights, Audrey and Nick become suspects themselves after the drop-off is bungled, and the French police are on the hunt for them. So, they must find the kidnapper and prove their innocence.&nbsp;</p><p>They stop by some notable Paris spots along the way, such as the Opera Garnier, which they don’t take advantage of as fabulously as the new “John Wick: Chapter 4” does.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Audrey (Jennifer Aniston) and Nick (Adam Sandler) search Paris for the Maharaja’s kidnapper. <span class=credit>©Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p>The biggest action sequence — still meh — in director Jeremy Garelick’s movie goes down at the Eiffel Tower and its famous restaurant, which brings to mind the worst-reviewed MGM James Bond flick of all time, “A View To A Kill.”&nbsp;</p><p>At least that Eiffel Tower chase had Roger Moore and Grace Jones.</p><p>When the identity of the murderer is revealed and and they suffer their eventual demise, the whole business is painfully uninteresting.</p><p>Netflix also is responsible for the “Knives Out” series, and while “Glass Onion” <a href=#>didn’t make my eyes water</a>, Rian Johnson’s send-up of Agatha Christie is leagues better than this formulaic, soulless schlock.&nbsp;</p><p>The streamer’s “Murder Mystery 2” amounts to nothing more than a free vacation for Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xmbGlfosKzsMSrZKaxo6mys8WMa2Srnaaesrh5zKipnmWTp66xecWrpqZlk5a%2FprjErKpmppWps62112g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./175081-luke-perrys-death-revealed-tv-son-archie-html.html><span>←</span><span>Luke Perry's Death Revealed to TV Son Archie Andrews in New 'Riverdale' Teaser</span></a>
