So far, Borns has released two studio albums – “Dopamine” and “Blue Madonna”. He has been active in the entertainment industry since 2010.</p><p>How much is the net worth of Børns? It has been reported by authoritative sources that the overall size of his wealth is equal to $12 million, as of the data presented at the beginning of 2018. Music is the major source of Borns’ fortune.</p><h3>Børns Net Worth $12 million</h3><p>To begin with, growing up in Grand Haven, Michigan, Borns became interested in art, but at only 10 years of age, he was a professional magician under the pseudonym Garrett the Great. At the age of 13, studying at White Pines Middle School, he won the Gold Key Award at the National Scholastic Art Award, and received a scholarship of $8,000 to Kendall College of Art and Design, part of the state university of Ferris State University.</p><p>Starting his musical career, Borns participated in the TEDx program, performing with his ukulele. In 2013, he left New York and moved to Los Angeles, soon calling LA his home. Within a few weeks of moving, Borns wrote the single “10,000 Emerald Pools”, co – created with Jack Kennedy. Borns was also successful in the fashion industry, and after performing in “The Tonight Show with <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon</a>”, Gucci noticed the singer and offered him cooperation. Borns was also a leader in the gender – bender movement, promoting nail polish and crop – tops in social media, so his career became multi-faceted and significantly raised his potential net worth.</p><p>The artist also admits that his androgynous voice and appearance led many people to confuse him with a woman. At the end of 2014, the debut single “10,000 Emerald Pools” was released by Interscope Records, alongside the release of the debut EP “Candy”. Borns guest subsequently starred on television and in talk shows, including “Conan”, and “Le Before du Grand Journal” in France. The singer started performing live as a support voice for Mister Wives on their tour entitled “Our Own House Tour”, before in 2015 his debut studio album “Dopamine” was released, which climbed to second place on the Billboard Alt and Rock charts. In the middle of the same year, he was the star of the evening at the Electrowerkz club in London, and was then accompanied by Charli XCX and Bleachers on their “Charli and Jack Do America Tour”, including at the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago. The artist also appeared at the “Life Is Beautiful”, and “Austin City Limits Music Festival”, and in 2016 Borns performed at the Iridium Jazz Club in New York, which was recorded by the American Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) for their series of concerts broadcast nationwide. He also performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival the same year. At the beginning of 2018, his second studio album – “Blue Madonna” – was released, containing the singles “Faded Heart”, “Sweet Dreams” and “God Save Our Young Blood”, and reached third place on the Billboard Alt chart.</p><p>Finally, in the personal life of the singer, Børns is still single, although singer Zella Day is known to be a close friend.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=14.325732899023><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Børns</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 7, 1992</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Muskegon, Michigan USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, songwriter</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>White Pines Middle School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=0.37209302325581><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/bornsmusic</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/bornsmusic</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.39130434782609><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/bornsmusic/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4460549/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.27118644067797><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bÃrns-mn0003323342</a></td></tr><tr><td>Record Labels</td><td>Interscope Records</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Albums</td><td>Dopamine (2015), Blue Madonna (2018)</td></tr><tr readability=13><td>Movies</td><td>BØRNS -
