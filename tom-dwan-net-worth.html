However, Tom is really known in the poker game for his successful performances in tournaments. Usually Tom plays online and is known by his screen name “durrr”. As Tom is still relatively young for a poker player, he is very likely to become even more acclaimed and popular.</p><p>So just how rich is Tom Dwan, as of late 2017? Authoritative sources estimate that Tom’s net worth is over $12 million, for the most part earned from his successful career as a poker player, which began in the game 15 years ago, when he was in his late teens, so there is a high chance that Tom Dwan’s net worth will grow, as he continues playing poker.</p><h3>Tom Dwan Net Worth $12 Million</h3><p>There is virtually no public information regarding Tom’supbringing and schooling, but he began playing poker when he was 17 years old. He used the money he got for his birthday to play online poker at “Paradise Poker”. At first he lost some money, but as soon as he focused more he started winning. Soon Tom began playing cash games and won several of them, and so his net worth began growing as he became more experienced. That is why Tom even decided to drop out of college in order to focus more on his career as a professional poker player. Of course, not everything was perfect,and to give an idea of his ups and downs, according to experts, Dwan won over $312,00 in 2007 on <a title="Full Tilt Poker" href=#>Full Tilt Poker</a> and $5.41 million in 2008. However,&nbsp; Dwan then admitted to losing over $2 million in a four-month period, but recovered it within a year. In early 2009, Dwan lost more than $3.5 million, but again recovered in just six months. However, in late&nbsp; 2009, Tom lost around approximately $2 million to <a title="Phil Ivey" href=#>Phil Ivey and</a> <a title="Ilari Sahamies" href=#>Ilari “Ziigmund” Sahamies,</a> and $5 million to <a title="Viktor Blom" href=#>Viktor Blom</a>.</p><p>In a 2008 World Series of Poker (WSOP) event held in the US, Dwan reached the final table in the $10,000 World Championship Mixed Event&nbsp; finishing in 8th place, earning $54,144, and shortly after again finished in 8th, this time in the $5,000 No Limit 2-7 Draw with Rebuys event, earning $45,110.</p><p>More recently, in 2016 he concentrated almost exclusively on private games, but in 2017 at the Macau Billionaire’s Poker 2017 Spring Challenge, Tom Dwan lost the final against Belarus player Mikita Badziakouski, but still walked away with the runner-up prize of $275,000. Furthermore, Tom holds the record for the largest pot won in a televised live game, when he won more than $1.1 million during the “Million Dollar Cash Game”. As of August 2017, his total live tournament winnings are officially known to exceed $2,900,000.</p><p>As to his personal life, well, there aren’t even any rumours regarding romantic liaisons – it seems that traveling the world playing poker leaves little time for Tom to engage in such assignations. He is still based in Edison, New Jersey.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.141592920354><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Tom Dwan</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 30, 1986</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Edison, New Jersey, United States</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Profession</td><td>Professional poker player, Member of Team Full Tilt Poker</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Boston University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Thomas Dwan</td></tr><tr readability=0.41176470588235><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/tomdwan</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.31578947368421><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/officialtomdwan/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm2943353</a></td></tr><tr readability=11><td>TV Shows</td><td>National Heads-Up Poker Championship (2005-2011), Full Tilt Durrrr Million Dollar Challenge (since 2010), H.O.R.S.E.
