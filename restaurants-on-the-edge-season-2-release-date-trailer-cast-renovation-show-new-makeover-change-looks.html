The premise is simple and inviting.

The experts change that for them and give owners a completely revamped menu and interiors resulting in an elevated eating experience.&nbsp;</p><p>If you have watched the maiden season, you'll know the camaraderie the co-hosts share is one of the major aspects that make the show special and unique. Each of them come with different skillset and ideas surrounding every renovation resulting in exciting content.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, the team traveled to the Alps, Hongkong, Malta, and a few other places to help restaurant businesses from closing down. Sounds fancy but, imagine putting together a reno show in an alien country? Quite challenge right? except it wasn't. The co-hosts did their research ahead of time and would have an assigned on-ground fixer in each country, which made their work pretty smooth.&nbsp;</p><p>"We always got a good rundown as far as what the currency is, what the language is if there are certain rules we'd have to abide by, like 'don't wear camo in this particular country,' or things like that," Nick told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Distractify</a>.</p><p>But, weather changes were one of the major hiccups that stood in the way of taping and even doing actual construction work on the sets. However, rough weather always adds to the drama, and therefore, it's good TV.</p><h2 class=split>Trailer</h2><p>Watch the clip <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Showrunners</h2><p>The exciting series is being produced by Marblemedia and OutEast Entertainment.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>If you like this, you'll love these:</h2><p>'Sugar Rush'</p><p>'Celebrity IOU'</p><p>'Love It Or List It'</p><p>'Nailed It'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpWowaLB0ZqlratdpLtuwMeeZJ6cl5p6tLHArKanZWJiv6a4xJqqnmWUlsGmedOrmKKklad6pK3SrWSrnZ6kw6LAyKilZquYpMRuusSwZKaZm5q8t7HRZpqhmZ6csm64zqiirA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./morning-show-viewers-cringe-at-jennifer-anistons-face.html><span>←</span><span>'Morning Show' viewers cringe at Jennifer Aniston's face</span></a>
