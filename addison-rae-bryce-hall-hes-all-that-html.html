They are&nbsp;popular TikTokers with a massive fan base.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Apart from their TikTok videos, Rae and Hall made headlines in 2019 because of the rumors surrounding their relationship.&nbsp;Rae acknowledged her relationship with Hall in September 2020.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>They broke up soon but renewed their romance a month later. Their relationship was public since they made adorable TikTok videos together. Unfortunately, the relationship didn't last long.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Cheating&nbsp;accusations about Hall appeared online in February 2021, and soon, the TikTok stars surprised fans by announcing their split.&nbsp;Although Hall denied the infidelity claims, the two parted ways in March 2021.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Rae shaded Hall</a> in a lie detector test on August 9, 2021, where she also confirmed&nbsp;that she is no longer friends with her exes. Hall was disappointed with the video, but he remains&nbsp;supportive of Rae and her career.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Rae's cinematic debut, <a href=# rel=follow>He's All That</a>, was released on August 27, 2021, and Hall has been nothing but supportive of his ex.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Bryce Hall's Surprise Cameo</h2><p>He's All That&nbsp;is a gender-swapped remake of the 1999 movie&nbsp;She's All That. The movie revolves around Rae's character Padgett Sawyer, a popular girl&nbsp;who had a humiliating fallout with her boyfriend.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>To recover from the humiliation and avenge herself, she accepts a challenge to make the school's least popular boy Cameron Kweller a prom king. However, emotions are at stake.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After the movie was released, Hall took to Twitter to appreciate Rae for her performance. She&nbsp;quote-tweeted Hall's appreciation and hinted that he has a cameo in the movie. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fans were happy but surprised when they learned about Hall's appearance. But since the movie was shot when Rae and Hall were together, it makes sense that Rae included her boyfriend in her first movie.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Hall made a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">surprise cameo</a> in an uncredited role in the movie. He played a friend of Sawyer's ex-boyfriend, Jordan, but had&nbsp;no dialogue.&nbsp;</p><p>He made an appearance to comfort Jordan after a heartbreak during the 'Drop it like F.Scott'&nbsp;party scene.&nbsp;Sawyer also is at the party, but she does not share any screen time with Hall's character.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Hall's fans were ecstatic to see their hero in the movie despite the movie's poor reviews.&nbsp;Even after the movie's premiere, Hall was commenting on Rae's Instagram posts about the film.&nbsp;</p><h2>'He’s All That' Did Not Satisfy Critics</h2><p>While Rae's fans believe she did a fantastic job, the movie did not satisfy the critics. On&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a>,&nbsp;the critics and audiences have mostly left harsh comments about&nbsp;the film.&nbsp;</p><p>As of today, it has received a 32% rating&nbsp;in Tomatometer and a 30% audience score. Similarly, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Washington Post</a> also disapproved of the movie, calling it "He’s All That is not all that." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Lastly, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Decider</a> also advised their readers to skip the movie. Many other critics share the same sentiments as these reviewers, but be the judge for yourself by watching He's All That on Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmUmba0u81mqZqdXZe%2Fuq%2FEZp%2BapJxitaa%2FjJqjpWWkna61esetpKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zlatan-ibrahimovic-reflects-on-conversation-with-wenger-and-the-failed-arsenal-move.html><span>←</span><span>Zlatan Ibrahimovic Reflects on Conversation with Wenger and the Failed Arsenal Move</span></a>
