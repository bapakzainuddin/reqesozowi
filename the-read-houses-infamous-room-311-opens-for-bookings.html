One of America’s most haunted rooms is opening up to the public for the first time since the Tennessee hotel underwent a $25 million renovation.
The Read House’s Room 311 in Chattanooga, known as Annalisa Netherly’s room, is now open for bookings for every Thursday in October for a one-night stay.
Netherly is said to haunt the facilities after, as the debated legend goes, she was nearly decapitated in a bathtub by a former lover — though some suggest she committed suicide in her own jealous rage."><meta name=author content="Kelle Repass"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

And we are excited to welcome new guests to share her room,” said general manager Ken Merkel in a statement <a href=# rel=noopener>to Forbes</a>.</p><p>“Room 311 looks and feels like Annalisa’s room in the 1920s. There is an AM radio that does not work, a vintage clawfoot tub, an original pull chain toilet, antique furnishings, and distressed hardwood floors just like it would have been in the early twentieth century and no television.”</p><p>Those paranormal accounts reportedly include flickering lights, unexplained noises, ghostly apparitions, and running water in the bathroom, according to the hotel’s website.</p><p>The hotel also reinstalled the bars over the windows that were put in place when Capone stayed in the room.</p><p>For those willing to brave the haunt, the limited-time “The Read House Haunted Room 311 Experience” package starts at $666 and will include overnight accommodations, complementary valet parking, a decanter of bathtub gin, two Annalisa cocktails at the hotel’s Bar & Billiards Room and room service for breakfast — assuming you don’t leave in the middle of the night.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnp7j3Jma29fqbWmedGemJ1lmKTCtLHSZqCnnpGivLa%2FjKumqKVdaH5yec6pnKerXZu8s3nBqKakoZ6cwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-howling-by-cathedrals.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Howling by Cathedrals</span></a>
