TRENDING</strong></p><p>JoJo Siwa Death Haox: One of the most well-known dancers, singers, actors, YouTubers, and media personalities in America is JoJo Siwa. Joelle Joanie “JoJo” Siwa is still alive, despite false reports claiming his death that have been making the rounds on social media.</p><p>In 2021, Siwa was included as one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People. She also founded the group XOMG Pop, which performed a rendition of “Candy Hearts” on the seventeenth season of America’s Got Talent.</p><p><strong>Who is JoJo Siwa?</strong></p><p>Joelle Joanie Siwa, born on May 19, 2003, in Omaha, Nebraska, began her career as a contestant on “Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition” and later appeared on “Dance Moms.” She gained widespread recognition with her single “Boomerang,” addressing online bullying.</p><p>D.R.E.A.M., Siwa’s first significant concert tour, began in 2018. Vivid Seats awarded the tour the title of Breakout Artist of the Year. Siwa’s impact was so great that Fast Company listed her among the Queer 50 in 2021 and Time listed her among the 100 most important people in 2020. Later, she became a judge on the seventeenth season of “So You Think You Can Dance.”</p><p>In September 2022, Siwa was given the GLSEN Gamechanger Award in recognition of her efforts to combat bullying. When she came out as a pansexual member of the LGBTQ+ community in January 2021, her personal life gained notice.</p><p>In February 2021, she declared her relationship with Kylie Prew, whom she later reconciled with in May 2022 after splitting up in late 2021. In June 2022, though, the couple split up once more. Siwa began dating Avery Cyrus in August 2022, but by December 2022, they had made their split public.</p><p>Joelle Joanie Siwa’s career has taken her in a number of different directions. She and J. C. Penney worked together to create a doll, accessories, and bedroom décor line. Siwa also wrote a number of books for younger readers.</p><p>Her hair bow line, which she developed in collaboration with Claire’s, became well-known in 2016, to the point where several UK schools banned it for distractions and for breaking dress codes. 2017 saw her join Nickelodeon, where she worked on shows like “Lip Sync Battle Shorties” and “Blurt!” Siwa was a competitor on “The Masked Singer” and an unlockable character in the video game series Nickelodeon Kart Racers.</p><p>Siwa made history by competing in dance with the Stars, where she formed the first-ever same-sex dance pair and placed second. The 2021 withdrawal of the board game Jojo’s Juice, however, caused controversy because of its offensive nature. General Mills released a cereal known as JoJo Siwa Strawberry Bop in the same year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkaq0qq3OrKZyZZKZe6aw1Getp2eapLewedKirppllJqutbSMoaaasF2staLAjKGYqaiVo7KledOoZJqllae2pK3NZpuappOav26tzZ1krKGenLKzecmonKWklWK3sK3Nopxmq5msrm7A0Z6lnaGenHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jesse-collins-net-worth-2.html><span>←</span><span>Jesse Collins Net Worth</span></a>
