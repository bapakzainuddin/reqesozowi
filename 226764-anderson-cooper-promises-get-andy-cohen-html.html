So, Cohen decided to post a picture of Cooper regardless — just to "piss him off."</p><p class=Fg>Cooper posted his rebuttal yesterday, showing an even more unflattering collage of his shirtless snaps. In his captions, the CNN news anchor <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.instagram.com/andersoncooper/>explained</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"I don't know how. I don't know when.

The two men have had each other to lean on in some of their milestone moments, as they share quite a lot in common.</p><p class=Fg>This year has been just as monumental for them. Cooper welcomed his son, Wyatt, in April. Being a single parent, he has taken some parenting advice from Cohen.</p><p class=Fg>The pair's friendship is interesting since they were almost set up on a blind date. However, things didn't quite pan out.</p><p class=Fg>Per reports, Cooper had <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/andy-cohen-anderson-coopers-best-bff-moments/>decided not to go on the date</a> because Cohen mentioned his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt. Despite the failed date, they chose to be friends instead and have been so since.</p><p class=Fg>Over the years, the pair has had to lean on each other — both personally and professionally. As <a class="Xd a" href=#>Cohen</a> recovered from the novel coronavirus earlier this year, Cooper was by his side, supporting him.</p><p class=Fg>As far as two peas in a pod go, it's almost impossible for Cohen and Cooper to be more identical. Cooper should have some interesting pictures to post and get back at Cohen with all that time spent together. The later might want to watch out!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtpb29maXqiusOeqaynnmKwsLvPnqlmqKKkuqq%2FxKxkoJ2kYq6vsNhmmqiglaN7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alex-canchari-wife-is-he-married-jockey-relationship-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Alex Canchari Wife: Is He Married?
