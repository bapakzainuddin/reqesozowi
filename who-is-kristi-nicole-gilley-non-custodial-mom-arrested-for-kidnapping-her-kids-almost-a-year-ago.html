Brooke Gilley and 12-year-old Adrian Gilley had been missing since March 15, 2022, police said. According to a missing person’s poster shared by the California Attorney General’s Office, March 15 is Adrian’s birthda, as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Law and Crime.</a></p><p>“On February 1, 2023, HSPD located two abducted Missouri children and their abductor after a routine vehicle tag check indicated the vehicle owner was a fugitive,” the High Springs Police Department said in a statement shared on Facebook. “Officers located the trio shopping in Winn Dixie, after disguising their identities.” “The children were turned over to the Florida Department of Children and Families Services and will be reunited with their birth family,” police added.</p><h2 class=split>Nicole Gilley arrested for parental kidnapping charges&nbsp;</h2><p>"Both Gilley kids have been safely located out of state," Liberty, Missouri Police Department wrote in an update. "Their non-custodial mother is in custody on parental kidnapping charges out of Clay County, Missouri. Thank you to everyone who shared this post as it helped bring these children home!!!," they added.&nbsp;</p><p>Kristi Gilley has been in the custody of Florida's Alachua County Sheriff's Office since 2.31 pm. on February 2, according to jail documents examined by the publication. The defendant will most likely stay there until she is transferred to Clay County, Missouri, where the arrest warrant was issued, and she will be charged with kidnapping. However, no records as of now are available on how the children were kidnapped.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>'Makes me wonder if this is a surrogate mother'</h2><p>"What took so long for someone to share these poor babies were missing, praying they’re found safe," one user reacted on Facebook. Other internet users were speculative saying, "I guarantee this woman is a victim of domestic abuse/coercive control/systemic abuse. Post more information about the father, please." More wrote, "Did you guys also read that the kids were being reunited with their BIRTH family? Since this woman is being called their non-custodial mother, makes me wonder if this is a surrogate case." Others asked, "There are 3 sides to every story, his, her, and the truth. No one will tell the whole truth."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKSpoquknnqvtcKoo55ll565rbHYZqWopl2YwrTAzp2gmqRdoryuecCrqZ6rpJqxbrLOq2SkoZSjrrG8yKeeZqCVp3qstcOsZJqknaTAtXnAZrCemaJirqi7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rosemarie-fritzl-elisabeth-mother-josef-sexual-abuse-daughter-unaware-actions-case-children-raise.html><span>←</span><span>Where is Rosemarie Fritzl now?
