A key piece of Philadelphia’s success this year — beyond the contributions from quarterback Jalen Hurts, a plethora of skill-position players, and its defense — has been Elliott in the kicking game.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The 2023 NFL Playoffs bracket entering the Divisional Round. <span class=credit>NY Post illustration</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Eagles kicker Jake Elliott lines up for a field-goal attempt against the Giants during their Week 18 matchup. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>The 27-year-old, who has spent his entire career with Philadelphia, made 87 percent of his field goals during the regular season, which was the second-highest percentage Elliott has ever compiled.
