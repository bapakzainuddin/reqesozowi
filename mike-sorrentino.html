They dated each other from 2004 to 2007. The couple exclusively&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>revealed their engagement </strong></a>in April 2018, after Mike popped the question while&nbsp;<i>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</i>&nbsp;cameras rolled.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lavish and Beautiful Wedding Ceremony</h2><p>For the weddings, Sorrentino wore a black suit and a matching bow tie, and his bride wore a fitted white and lace gown with a veil. After the couple partied the night away with their guests — including cast mates&nbsp;<strong>Deena Cortese, Angelina Pivarnick, Pauly “DJ Pauly D” DelVecchio.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/6/20/b206efb3c1dfbaeb423dae1c028de0bc%20(1)-1592652155746.jpg><p>Sorrentino opted for a red tracksuit, which his groomsmen also wore. They were personalized with an S. The S refereed for Sorrentino and was on the left chest area along with their names on the back.</p><p>For her departing look, Pesce decided on a bejeweled, high-neck white gown.

That all changed when he failed to pay his taxes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/6/20/1%20(1)-1592652683484.jpg><p><a href=#><strong>Amy Paffrath </strong></a>also rose to fame after appearing in Jersey Shore and has a net worth of&nbsp;<strong>$1 Million.&nbsp;</strong>Sorrentino worked in a gym and then modeled underwear before he was cast on the show.

He was also one of those who appeared on Comedy Central’s roast of Donald Trump, but most of his jokes were booed. The Actor recently had to give away his Bentley worth <strong>$100,000</strong> as the fine.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Check Out More Diversifying Things About Celebrities' Personal Life & Career Highlights At&nbsp;</strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong>!!!</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqagpJ1dqLyzvsSnq6Kmnw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katie-richards-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Katie Richards Obituary, Former UND, Mayville State University, Family</span></a>
