After Sunday’s five-catch, 60-yard performance, which included his third touchdown of the season, it is clear he and Mahomes are on the same page.</p><p>In fact, Rice sits behind only Travis Kelce on the team-targets leaderboard, and you can expect his role to continue increasing as the season rolls on.</p><p>We are seeing something similar in Indianapolis, as Josh Downs seems to have the attention of his new quarterback Gardner Minshew. The rookie standout is averaging a 70 percent snap share, and though he still might not be on the field as much as Alec Pierce, Downs has easily surpassed him in targets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/alarm.jpg><p>Over the past three weeks, Downs has seen 20 targets to just 11 for Pierce, has touchdowns in each of his past two and just racked up his first 100-yard game. With Anthony Richardson lost for the season, Minshew is staying right where he is, and Downs is going to reap the benefits.</p><p>When you’re scratching and clawing for fantasy wins, you have to accept the fact that not every veteran on your roster is worthy of a starting spot. Rice and Downs are perfect examples of under-the-radar players who can be starting every week, and more are on the way.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Betting on the NFL?</h2><p>If you’re sitting atop your standings and looking to strengthen your roster, put in waiver claims or start making trade offers for these kids.</p><p>Howard Bender is the head of content at FantasyAlarm.com.
