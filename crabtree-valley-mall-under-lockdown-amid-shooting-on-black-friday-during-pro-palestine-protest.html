Police responded to reports of shots fired at approximately 10:07 a.m. at the mall located on 4325 Glenwood Avenue.</p><p>Upon arrival, law enforcement and mall security swiftly determined that no shots were discharged, and thankfully, no injuries were reported. The confusion stemmed from a small group of Pro-Palestinian protesters within the mall premises, creating a commotion that startled shoppers, causing them to rush towards the exits.</p><p>The exact cause of the noise that triggered the panic is under scrutiny by officers who are diligently seeking to ascertain the source. Notably, this incident did not mark the first instance of false gunshot reports at Crabtree Valley Mall. A similar situation unfolded in August 2022 when the police responded to reports of gunshots, yet no evidence corroborated such claims after the mall was evacuated.</p><p>According to the watch commander from the Raleigh Police Department, the Pro-Palestinian protesters congregated in the food court, vocalizing calls for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict, utilizing bullhorns and raising their voices. Their actions escalated as they knocked over a table, inadvertently intensifying the atmosphere within the mall. Shoppers, mistakenly perceiving this sound as gunfire, promptly sought cover, prompting a partial lockdown of the mall while authorities conducted their investigation.</p><p>Fortunately, the situation was quickly resolved as the Pro-Palestinian protesters were peacefully escorted out by the police. The mall resumed its regular operations after a temporary interruption caused by the investigation. Currently, Crabtree Valley Mall is open for business as usual.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51ksLOtwa2pnp1dq66tuMSyZKaZnKF6trrDnqlmpJ%2BYuKW71qdkmqWZmXq0tM6oq6Kml2K8r3nBpZico12bv6qwwLJkna2inruoec%2BrpmaokaGytMDIp5xmqKKkwaa%2F02g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-hayes-net-worth-13.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Hayes Net Worth</span></a>
