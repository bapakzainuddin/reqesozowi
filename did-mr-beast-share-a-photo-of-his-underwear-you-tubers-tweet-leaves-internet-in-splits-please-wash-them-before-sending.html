Still got a long way to being yoked but I’m happy with my progress so far.”&nbsp; This tweet garnered over 67 million views.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after, MrBeast shared another tweet, expressing his astonishment at the immense number of people who had seen him in his underwear. He mused, "50 million people saw me in my underwear yesterday... why do I have this much power?" In response to this, a Twitter user asked MrBeast&nbsp; “If this gets 50,000 likes can I have the underwear you were wearing in the picture?” MrBeast promptly replied, “I’ll consider it.”</p><p>This interaction resonated with millions, as the Twitter user's tweet garnered nearly 91,000 likes.
