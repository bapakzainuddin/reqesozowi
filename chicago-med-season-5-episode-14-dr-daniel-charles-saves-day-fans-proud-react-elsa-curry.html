When Dr Curry notices a catatonic boy's leg move, she reports the finding to Dr Charles.</p><p>Dr Charles is able to diagnose that the boy can still be saved and he decides to notify the parents. When the boy is taken off ventilation, he breathes on his own. This moment was big for fans as they appreciated the doctor's actions.</p><p>One fan , "Dr Charles is a risk taker but knows his limits even when taking them to the edge," while another , "Love that they are expanding Dr Charles' role. AMAZING actor."</p><p>A viewer , "Charles just saved Xavier's life. The man is a legend. #ChicagoMed," and another , "Great take from dr Charles. That was great that he saw that. No other doctors caught it."</p><p>Later, Dr Charles and Dr Curry try to figure out what may have led to the boy's vegetative state. On speaking to the mother, Dr Charles guesses that the stepfather's job as a cop may have led to the boy developing a certain fear that led to his current state.</p><p>Dr Curry calls Chicago PD to figure out the stepfather's job to understand what might be affecting the boy. Though Dr Charles reprimands Dr Curry for violating the patients' trust, they figure out what may have affected the child.</p><p>The doctors learn that there was a threat to the stepfather's life. At one point the boy noticed his stepfather's car's wreckage (from an accident) being towed away. Dr Charles suggests that the boy's understanding of how scary his stepfather's job is may have led to his catatonic state.</p><p>While the boy's mother is angry at the suggestion, the stepfather understands that he may have to step aside to save the boy. Dr Charles says that while the stepfather steps aside while the boy recovers, he has to be there when the boy starts therapy so that they can move forward as a family.</p><p>The family's pain is palpable as the boy wakes up and the stepfather watches him from a distance, tearing up.&nbsp;</p><p>Though it is Dr Charles' diagnosis that helped the boy, he credits Dr Curry for bringing it to his notice — thereby preventing the boy from remaining in a catatonic state. His conduct in the episode proves why Dr Charles is one of the integral members — both of the hospital and the show.</p><p>'Chicago Med' airs on NBC on Wednesday nights at 8/7c.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom5iesKKzzmaknpxdqLKiv86nZG5llaW2tLvDnmRqbF2Zv26wwKegnqRdmLWivsueqmarkauytHnDmrBmnpGjwG680aisnWWimq6kwIyeo6yZXZjCs77Y</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ariana-biermann.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Instagram Model, Ariana Biermann Dating?
